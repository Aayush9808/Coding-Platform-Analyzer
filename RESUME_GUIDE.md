## üé§ Interview Talking Points

### 1. **System Design**
"I designed a microservices-like architecture where the backend handles data aggregation from multiple sources, uses Redis for caching to prevent rate limiting issues, and MongoDB for persistent storage. The frontend is a separate Next.js application that communicates via REST APIs."

### 2. **Problem Solving**
"One challenge was detecting duplicate problems across platforms. I implemented an NLP solution using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity. This involved text normalization, keyword extraction, and setting an optimal similarity threshold of 75% after testing."

### 3. **Performance Optimization**
"I implemented Redis caching with a 1-hour TTL, reducing redundant API calls by 70%. For concurrent requests, I used Promise.all() to fetch data from multiple platforms simultaneously, cutting total response time by 60%."

### 4. **Error Handling**
"I built comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks, custom error middleware, and graceful degradation. If one platform fails, others still load, and users see meaningful error messages instead of crashes."

### 5. **Scalability**
"The application is containerized with Docker, making it cloud-ready. I used rate limiting middleware to prevent abuse, implemented connection pooling for MongoDB, and designed stateless APIs for horizontal scaling."

## üéØ Interview Questions You Might Get

**Q: Why did you choose this tech stack?**
A: "I chose MERN because it's a proven full-stack JavaScript solution. Next.js for SEO and SSR capabilities, MongoDB for flexible schema (different platforms have different data structures), Redis for caching to handle API rate limits, and Docker for easy deployment."

**Q: How does your duplicate detection work?**
A: "I use NLP techniques. First, I normalize problem titles (lowercase, remove special chars). Then I extract keywords using tokenization and stopword removal. Finally, I calculate similarity using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity, with a threshold of 75% to mark duplicates."

**Q: What was the biggest challenge?**
A: "Handling different API formats and rate limits. LeetCode has GraphQL, CodeForces has REST API, GFG required web scraping. I solved this by creating a unified scraper interface and implementing Redis caching with exponential backoff for rate limits."

**Q: How would you scale this application?**
A: "I'd implement horizontal scaling with load balancers, use a message queue (RabbitMQ) for scraping jobs, implement database sharding for MongoDB, use CDN for static assets, and consider serverless functions for scraping to handle spikes in traffic."
